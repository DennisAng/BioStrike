Biocoins
==========

Biocoin is envisioned to conceive an objective measure of a current valuation of antibiotic potential of the soil samples biostrikers are harvesting. The concept emulates Solarcoin, which pegs a digital currency against modern valuation of generated solar energy. Biocoin is also a kind of gamification point system to incentivize participation in Biostrike.

There are differences between Biocoin and Solarcoin. An individual may readily accept solar energy generated as immediately usable, but he would be unable to accept the tangible final deliverable of the Biostrike project, which are gene sequences from harvested soil samples, as something of immediate value. While Solarcoin pegs against solar energy which translates directly into a usable form that can see ready demand, Biocoin would have to involve an extra step. Secondly, while solar energy can be readily consolidated into the same form, disparate soil samples cannot be combined as such. This lends reason to establish Biocoin as a form of digital point system that serve also as identifiers that individually tracks the progress of harvested soil samples. This also allows the tracking of the transaction of Biocoin on a [distributed consensus ledger](https://medium.com/future-of-currency/c65e368d4b3) much akin to Bitcoin. 

The running value of Biocoin rests on a collective's input of existing currencies into the project. Individual investors, corporations and governments are able to contribute to the central pool of Biocoin fund as a proxy measure of current demand for new antibiotics. If so, why the need for a digital currency in the first place?

The mechanism comes full circle as we explain that Biocoin is not a cryptocurrency yet still a digital currency that allows for a current identifier of genetic sequencing, which may take time to fully unravel. Unlike Bitcoin, there is no mining to complete hash sequences but "mining" to unravel unknown genetic sequences. Rather than employ precious computing power to mine something of arbitrary value, the "mining" here actually accomplishes something that creates new and valuable knowledge.

# How it works

Before the genetic sequences are fully unraveled, a Biocoin identifier with a nominal value is tagged to these yet-to-be-unraveled genetic sequences. Biocoin is also awarded to people who contribute computing power to the Biostrike program, which like SETILive allows a voluntary collective to contribute towards a crowdsourcing venture of finding extraterrestrial intelligence. Again a nominal value is attached to these efforts. When you do discover something of clear antibiotic potential, your nominal Biocoin is boosted to an order commensurate to the investor pool set aside for sequences that will help humanity.

Investors to the Bitcoin project are able to delineate how much real world money goes towards definitive antibiotic discovery and how much goes towards the necessary but laborious task of harvesting and "mining" of genetic sequences in the Biostrike repository.

It is by default suggested that 20% of Biostrike funding goes towards harvesting and mechanical turk tasks, while 80% premium awarded to those high impact sequences.
